# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

I made it for Android devices, so I am not sure if it works for IOS devices.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npm run start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

Use the Expo Go app by connecting your divice by wire to your computer 

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

The connection to Firebase is done through expo by using web connection even if it's for an Android device, besause we don't want to use Android studio.

Firebase is used for Authentication, data storage in db, images storage.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
